Data manipulation

Panda X Polars

What is Polars?
Polars is a specialized livrary to work with massive datasets and manipulation data.
A high-performance DataFrame library

Polars is primarily written in Rust.

What is one key advantage of Polars over Pandas?
Faster performance and lower memory usage.

Which type of executation model does Polars support for query optimization?
Lazy Executation

Key features of Polars
- Based on Apache Arrows - uses Arrow's columnar format for efficient data representation
- Lazy Evaluation - unlike Pandas, Poalrs supports lazy executation, optimizing queries before executation
- Multi-threaded Processing: leverages Rust's parallelism for fast computation
- Memory efficiency: reduces memory footprint by avoiding unecessary copies
- SQL-like Querying: provides powerful query APIs similar to SQL
- PySpark Alternative: Often compared wqith PySpark for handling large datasets efficiently
