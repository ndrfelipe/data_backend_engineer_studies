"""
Basic Sintax Annotations

Python multi-line statements
Python allow the use of the line continuation
character (\) to denote that the line should
continue. For example:
"""

item_one = item_two = item_three = 1

total = item_one + \
        item_two + \
        item_three

print(total)

"""
    Multiple Statement Groups as Suites
    A group of individual statements, which make a single code block are called suites in Python.
    Compound or complex statements, such as if, while, for, def and class require a header line and a suite
    Example:
    if expression:
        suite
    elif: expression :
        suite:
    else:
        suite
